# FlexWorkTracker

The application requires .NET 4.5, as well as Office of some sort.
Preferrably 2013, as that is the object library used when creating the application.

Saving is under the File Menu, or you will be prompted when closing the application.

All information is stored in excel sheets in the Flexwork Folder under the user's Documents Folder.
